Resque-timed-round-robin
==================

A plugin for Resque that implements round-robin behavior for workers.

Resque 1.25 is the only requirement.

The standard behavior for Resque workers is to pull a job off a queue,
and continue until the queue is empty.  Once empty, the worker moves
on to the next queue (if available).

This gem changes that behavior and will work a single queue for a specified amount of time (default is 60s) before rotating to a new queue.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'resque-round-robin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Nothing special.  This gem monkey-patches things so this is automatic.

Set the `DEFAULT_SLICE_LENGTH` environment variable to specify the amount of time (in seconds) to work a single queue before rotating.
